An experimental hypertext system

This is an erlang port of a project I originally wrote in PROLOG in 2007 or 2008. It was probably written in 2009 or 2010. It was based vaguely upon the [FeBe Protocol](http://udanax.com/green/febe/index.html), and can be considered to be a revisitation of the principles explored in [Udanax Green (also called XU88)](http://udanax.com/green/). Since I'm now involved in actual Xanadu(R) related projects, and this code hasn't had any love in several years, I decided to release it. It does not use any proprietary information.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to find the original PROLOG code (which would have run only under SWI-prolog, and might have been tied to a particular release now five or six years old).

This code doesn't work properly, because I had only a limited grasp of erlang. However, it was easier to debug than the PROLOG version, since it ran faster -- I didn't use the old slogan 'fail as soon as possible' properly!
